# 🌍 Carbon Emissions Analysis using SQL & Power BI

Welcome to the **Carbon Emissions Analysis Project**, where we explore global carbon emission trends using powerful data tools: **SQL** for querying and analysis, and **Power BI** for visualization.



## 🧠 Project Overview

In this project, I dive into carbon emission data to uncover insights like:

- 🇺🇸 **Highest and lowest carbon emissions in the U.S. over the years**
- 🌐 **Global leaders and reducers in per capita emissions**
- 📉 **Emission trends between 1975 and 2017**
- 💡 **Sector-wise potential for carbon reduction**

## 🛠️ Tools & Features

### 🗃 SQL Highlights
Utilized for data cleaning and deep analysis using:

- `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`
- Aggregates: `MIN()`, `MAX()`, `SUM()`, `ROUND()`
- Advanced statements: `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT INTO`, `WITH AS`, `INNER JOIN`

### 📈 Power BI Highlights
Used to create compelling visual stories:

- 📊 **Clustered Column Chart**
- 📍 **Donut Chart**
- 🌄 **Area Chart**
- 🔢 **Multi-row Cards**
- 🧠 **Smart Narrative with Dynamic Text**
- 🎛 **Slicers for user interactivity**

## 📂 Datasets

### 1️⃣ Carbon Emission Database  
**📌 Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
**📋 Description:**  
Contains yearly carbon emissions per capita and total emissions by country worldwide.

- 🔧 Processed with: `SQL`
- 📊 Visualized with: `Power BI`

---

### 2️⃣ Reduced Carbon Emission Database  
**📌 Source:** UN Environment Programme  
**📋 Description:**  
Details potential emission reductions across **six key sectors** (e.g., energy, transport, industry, etc.)

- 📊 Visualized with: `Power BI`

---


## 🧩 Key Insights

- 📌 **Top emitters per capita** in 2017 vs 1975 show dramatic shifts in global emission responsibilities.
- 🌿 **Renewable energy and transport sectors** hold the highest potential for emission reductions.
- 🇺🇸 The **U.S. exhibits fluctuating emission patterns** influenced by policy and industrial shifts.
